This is just a number 1995 and now the real text. The war in Asia began when the Empire of Japan invaded China on 7 July 1937.[4] The United States reacted by placing an oil embargo on Japan. The start of the war in Europe was when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. France and Britain reacted by declaring war on Germany. By 1941, much of Europe was under German control. Only Britain remained fighting against the Axis in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. In June 1941, the Axis Powers invaded the Soviet Union, starting the largest area of war in history. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States and Western colonies in the Pacific and the two wars became one.
