# Time_Matters


This project consists on a extractor of relevants dates from texts.

the module are composed by 2 parts

    - Creation of a inverted indext to organize the following data:
        - Frequency the word or date that occour on text,
        - how many sentences that word or date appears.
        - Exact position on sentence that the word or date appears.

    - Calculate the similarity of the relevant words with the canditate to relevant date.




### Install Time_Matters
``` bash
Git clone https://github.com/JMendes1995/Time_Matters.git
cd Time_Matters
python setup.py install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to use Time_Matters
``` bash
from time_matters import timeMatters
text = '''
Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincar√© and others. Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others did subsequent work.
Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916.

```
##### Analyze all dates from entire text
``` bash
# assuming default parameters
timeMatters(text)

# with all paramiters
output = timeMatters(txt, contextual_window_distance=10, threshold=0.05, max_array_len=0, max_keywords=10, analisys_sentence=True)

print(output)
#output
[{'Date': '1905', 'Score': 0.9980984799637649}, {'Date': '1907', 'Score': 0.9885848306283148}, {'Date': '1915', 'Score': 0.9467018487599099}, {'Date': '1916', 'Score': 0.8163265306122448}]
```

##### Analyze dates per text sentence
``` bash
# assuming default parameters
timeMattersPerSentence(text)

# with all paramiters
output = timeMattersPerSentence(txt, contextual_window_distance=10, threshold=0.05, max_array_len=0, max_keywords=10)

print(output)
#output
[{'Sentence 1': {'Date': '1905', 'Score': 1.0}}, {'Sentence 3': {'Date': '1907', 'Score': 1.0}}, {'Sentence 3': {'Date': '1915', 'Score': 0.8908296943231436}}, {'Sentence 4': {'Date': '1916', 'Score': 1.0}}]
